# Generate images of numbers using GAN

In this project, I implemented _Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network_ using _PyTorch_ to generate handwritten digits. I create a generator that will learn to generate images that look real and a discriminator that will learn to tell real images apart from fakes.

This is original numbers

and this is generated numbers

This is a project I've done in [Coursera Project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/deep-learning-with-pytorch-generative-adversarial-network) and I got [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/cebbeb26a25a865f7d54a146499568ed) when I finished it.
